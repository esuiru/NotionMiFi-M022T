# NotionMiFi-M022T
LTE MIFI from Notion
Rebranded as Youwin
Common in Emerging economies LTE telcom providers. 

I'm messing with a Notion MiFi M022T and it is a full of exploits. WPA PSK password is last 8 of IMEI. Meaning it is easily possibly to grab a handshake and break it. It prefixes last four of the mac address to the SSID. 

Also, you can dump user/pass without having to login to the admin portal.

So, that's nifty, right?
